### Difference between var and val

1. var : var is like general variable and it's known as a mutable variable in kotlin and can be assigned multiple times.
2. val : val is like Final variable and it's known as immutable in kotlin and can be initialized only single time.

Note : Function parameters can only be val(not to be mentioned explicitly). Previously mutable parameters were allowed to be used in functions, but in the latest version of Kotlin, the support is removed.
